<p><strong>Project:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Creating a Custom Model</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: What is a Model?</p>
<p>If you’ve made it this far, you probably know a little bit about models. Models tell Minecraft what shape an object should be and how to display textures on that shape.</p>
<p>The models in our mod so far have been pretty easy to make. All of them use a default Minecraft model as a ‘parent,’ meaning that they inherit (copy) most of the information,  such as their shape.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/09/23/model_file_example2.png" alt="Model file example" width="100%" height="100%" />></p>
<p>For example, tutorial_block uses the parent “minecraft:block/cube_all”. This model tells the game that tutorial_block is a cube that has the same texture on each side. If we had used “minecraft:block/slab” instead, it would have given tutorial_block a different shape and Minecraft would not have known how to use the texture, because slabs have a “bottom”, “top”, and “side” textures that we need to  specify individually.</p>
<p>Using pre-existing models as a “parent” saves a lot of time. What if you want to create something totally new though?. Let’s explore how to create our own custom model.</p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Opening Blockbench and Starting your First Model</p>
<ol><li>Open Blockbench! Blockbench is a special 3D modeling software that will do a lot of the hard work of making sure Minecraft can read our model.</li></ol>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/08/22/opening_blockbench1.gif" alt="Opening Blockbench GIF" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<p>You can open Blockbench by clicking on the search bar at the bottom left corner, then typing in “Blockbench.” Make sure you have Blockbench selected, then click “Open.”</p>
<li>Create a new project. </li></ol>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/08/22/new_blockbench_project_1.gif" alt="New Blockbench Project GIF" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<p>First click on “Java Block/Item Model,” then write a name for the new thing you are creating (Remember: No spaces!). Click “Confirm” and your project will open.</p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Moving the Camera: Rotation</p>
<p>Now that we’ve created our first project in Blockbench, let’s learn the basic controls.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/08/22/move_perspective3.gif" alt="Rotation GIF" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<p>You can rotate the camera by clicking and dragging anywhere in the workspace.</p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Moving the Camera: Zooming</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/08/22/zoom1.gif" alt="Zooming GIF" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<p>If you’re using a mouse, you can zoom in and out using the scroll wheel.</p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Moving the Camera: Panning</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/08/22/move_perspective4.gif" alt="Panning GIF" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<p>You can pan (move) across the screen by right clicking and dragging anywhere in the workspace.</p>
<p>Make sure to use these controls to move around as you work, since sometimes your model may appear different from what you intended from a certain perspective.</p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Creating a Cube</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/09/07/new_cube1.gif" alt="Creating a Cube" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<p>You can create a cube by clicking on the grey “+” button on the right side of your screen. Cubes are the only shape available in Blockbench, but you can use as many as you want.</p>
<p>You can also right click on the cube in the menu on the bottom right and select “delete” if you wish to delete a cube, or “duplicate” if you wish to duplicate a cube.</p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Moving Cubes</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/09/07/move_tool1.gif" alt="Moving Cubes" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<p>You can move a cube in different directions by dragging on the arrows pictured when you click on the cube with the move tool.</p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Resizing Cubes</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/09/07/resize_tool1.gif" alt="Resizing a Cube" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<p>You can change the shape of your cube by dragging on the arrows with square tips pictured when you click on the cube with the resize tool.</p>
<p>Try to avoid overlapping cubes whenever possible to prevent visual glitches later.</p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Organizing your Workspace: Naming</p>
<p>Naming is an important part of being a programmer. A good name will tell you exactly what something is supposed to be. It will help other people understand your creations and also help you remember what you were working on if you take a break! Do you remember what Minecraft called its model for a cube that has the same texture on all its sides? cube_all. The name tells you exactly what it’s supposed to be. Give each of your cubes a unique name. Numbers are OK, but try to give descriptive names wherever possible. Even if this cube will be part of something else later, you should still give it a descriptive name - you never know when you might need to deconstruct your creation.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/09/07/naming_cubes1.gif" alt="Naming a Cube" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<p>You can name your cube by double clicking on it in the “Outliner” at the bottom right corner of your screen. Whichever cube you are currently editing on in the workspace will show up as grey on the outline.</p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Organizing your Workspace: Grouping</p>
<p>You can also keep your workspace organized by grouping your cubes together based on their location, shape, and/or purpose.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/09/07/using_groups1.gif" alt="Grouping Cubes" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<p>You can group cubes together by either creating a folder (click on the folder icon) and then dragging them in, or by selecting them all at once (click on the first item, then hold shift and click on the last item at the same time) and then clicking on the folder icon. You should give each group a unique name, just like your cubes.</p>
<p>You can even make groups of groups!</p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Finishing up your First Model</p>
<p>Take a minute to finish up your first model. Once we get started on the texture, it will be a lot harder to make adjustments to the shape of your model. We took a shortcut for creating new textures that were applied to Minecraft’s default models by coloring over the default texture that went with the model. Someone had already figured out how to match the 2D texture to the 3D model. We’re going to be doing things a bit differently for our custom models. </p>
<p><strong>Project:</strong><strong> Making a Matching Texture</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Before you get Started</p>
<p>Previously, we’ve made all our textures using paint.net. This time, we’re going to use a tool in Blockbench to draw our own custom textures straight on our models. Blockbench will take care of unfolding these textures into 2D drawings.</p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Generating a Template for your Texture</p>
<p>The first step to making a custom texture in Blockbench is to generate a template. This will allow us to paint freely on multiple parts of our model all at once.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/09/07/texture_template1.gif" alt="Creating a Texture Template" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<ol><li>Select all the cubes in your model. You can do that by holding down the “CTRL” key and clicking on all the groups in your project AND any cubes not inside a group. You can tell which cubes are selected because they will show up as a lighter grey than the rest. </li>
<li>Create a texture template by clicking on the “Create textures” button under “Textures” on the bottom left, giving your texture a name, checking “Template”, then clicking “Confirm”.</li></ol>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Creating your Texture in Blockbench</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is draw on the model to create our texture.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/09/07/painting_texture1.gif" alt="Painting a Texture" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<p>You can do this by selecting “Paint” at the top right, choosing your desired color in the color palette, then drawing on your model. At the top of your screen, you can select different tools like the paint tool, paint bucket tool, and more. These tools should be pretty similar to the ones you used in Paint.Net, even if they look a little different.</p>

<p>Resource: Exporting your Work from Blockbench</p>
<p>Now, the last thing we need to do is export your amazing work!</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/09/07/saving_model_and_texture1.gif" alt="Saving Model and Texture" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<ol><li>To save your model, click File → Export → Export Block/Item Model , then make sure to save it in your “Mod Assets” file in the appropriate location. Since I created a block, I’m going to save mine in Mod Assets → Blocks.</li>
<li>To save your texture, click on the “Save” Icon to the right of your texture in the “Textures” menu. Just like your model, remember to save it in the appropriate location in your “Mod Assets” file.</li></ol>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Before we add your Model...</p>
<p>Congratulations on making it this far! Blockbench isn’t an easy tool to use. If you haven’t created an item or block to implement your custom model, now is the time to do that. Feel free to go back to “Creating an Item” or “Creating a Block” in “Big Cheese” if you need help! </p>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Adding your Model & Texture to an Item</p>
<ol><li>If you made an item, you’ll want to replace the .json model file you created for that item with the .json model file you saved in Mod Assets → Items.</li>
<li>Then, make the modifications shown in the gif below. You should be replacing “block” in your .json model file with “empowtutorial:items”.</li></ol>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.empow.me/media/cms/resources-files/2021/09/23/editing_item_model2.gif" alt="Editing Item Model File" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>
<li>Lastly, make sure to add your texture file from Mod Assets → Items into your items texture package in Eclipse.</li></ol>
<hr>
<p>Resource: Adding your Model & Texture to a Block</p>
<ol><li>If you made a block, you’ll want to replace the .json model file you created for that block inside “blocks” with the .json model file you saved in Mod Assets → Blocks.</li>
<li>Then, make the modifications shown in the gif below. You should be replacing “block” in your .json model file with “empowtutorial:blocks”.</li></ol>
